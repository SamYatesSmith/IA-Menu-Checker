# The Checker by EDIBLE

Software which checks a food menu against a users allergies and intolerances to highlight what on the menu the user can or cannot eat.

## The Checker

The Checker is a functional menu analyser.  The primary goal of the Checker is to assess a menu's ingredients in order to ascertain whether a customer is safe to eat any particular item on the menu.  Intolerances and Allergies can be incredibly serious, and if the customer is not properly advised on ingredients, intolerances and allergies can be deadly.  EDIBLE offer restaurants, cafe's, sandwhich shops, supermarkets or any food outlet with ingredients, the opportunity to allow their customers information about what is safe for them to eat.  

The user would start by listing what their dietary preference is, for example whether they're a vegetarian, a vegan or they're happy to eat anything.  This is in the form of a checkbox.  Following this input, a secondary checkbox based input is required; any allergies or intolerances to certain ingredients.  The Checker, once initiated, would then return everything that is safe to eat on the menu, alleviating any of the users concerns about ingesting food which could be harmful to them.
